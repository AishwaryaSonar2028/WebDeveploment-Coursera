                        Vegetarianism is the practice of abstaining from the consumption of meat (red meat, poultry, seafood, and the flesh of any other animal), and may also include abstention from by-products of animal slaughter.Vegetarianism may be adopted for various reasons. Many people object to eating meat out of respect for sentient life.Such ethical motivations have been codified under various religious beliefs, as well as animal rights advocacy. Other motivations for vegetarianism are health-related, political, environmental, cultural, aesthetic, economic, or personal preference. There are variations of the diet as well: an ovo-lacto vegetarian diet includes both eggs and dairy products,an ovo-vegetarian diet includes eggs but not dairy products, and a lacto-vegetarian diet includes dairy products but not eggs.

                        Non-vegetarian (non-veg) is an Indian English word that is used to refer to meaty food and also to a person who is a meatarian not a vegetarian i.e. someone who consumes meat, especially as a major source of protein.[1][2] Although the intended meaning is readily understood, these terms are not common parlance in the Anglosphere (English-speaking countries) where meat consumption is the norm, vegetarianism is a rarity, and veganism is a novelty. A related word is eggetarian, that refers to a vegetarian who consume egg based products but not meat.

                        A soft drink (see ยง Terminology for other names) is a drink that usually contains water (often carbonated), a sweetener, and a natural and/or artificial flavoring. The sweetener may be a sugar, high-fructose corn syrup, fruit juice, a sugar substitute (in the case of diet drinks), or some combination of these. Soft drinks may also contain caffeine, colorings, preservatives, and/or other ingredients.Soft drinks are called "soft" in contrast with "hard" alcoholic drinks.
